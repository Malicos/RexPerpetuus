#Moving forming decisions to BtPLReplaceVanillaCountryFormations

#I normally don't like messing with vanilla files when I don't have to, but between all the map changes and the fact that I wanted to clean up a few things
#and make everything more dynamic anyway, I figured I'd just reorganise. Hope this doesn't mess with anyone too much. - Draiocht

#Note I'm also standardising Ireland a bit, compared to other nations. The Irish favouritism was awesome and engaging, but I feel like it wasn't worth the
#updating work, balance concerns, and irregularities for only a couple extra dev. Still keepin HR's Clan - Province - Kingdom chain though, obviously,
#and most of the fun flavour.
