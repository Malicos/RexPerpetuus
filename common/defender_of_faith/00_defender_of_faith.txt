#BT16 Overhauled by Dub
#The entire design gist is based off a conversation from 2022, where the philosophy is the following:
#-Theocracies want their religion to have a defender of faith.
#-The defender's clergy should be happy about its country declaring a defender of faith and willing to contribute to your cause.
#-You shall be able to draft armies more easily if you're a defender of faith
#-Political benefits such as more religious currency should only show up if your faith is large enough
#-A defender of the faith should not have good relations with countries of other religions.
#-Defender of the faith T5 should not just be a dump tier for specifically Sunni/Catholic nations like it is in vanilla.
