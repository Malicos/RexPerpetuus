#Contributions from a wide range, including Draiocht, JP, 
#(JP) Welsh Brythonic, will overwrite brythonic.txt. However, it is unlike this will be used due to me moving most Brythonic to brythonic.txt
#(JP) I have reorganised and cleaned up all the prior Welsh/Brythonic naming to try and make it more legible, consistant and keep it easier to edit in future
#(JP) I make absolutely 0 claim to speak, understand, or even comprehend celtic languages. Please correct me when I am wrong!
#(JP) Due to names being primaly in brythonic.txt, it is likely this file will end up as a dummy file
