#Chairman Meow (JP) here! The rules themselves were set out by Draiocht, though will continue to be followed
#If you want to suggest names, please use the following format and suggest them to me on Discord or on the #Localised_Naming channel on the BT Discord.

#Language

#Region 1
1234 = { "Province Name" "Capital Name" }
1235 = { "Province Name" "Capital Name" }
1236 = { "Province Name" "Capital Name" }

#Region 2
7890 = { "Province Name" "Capital Name" }

#Rules for Names
Rule #1) Modern spellings. We're not looking for modern-founded settlements, nor modern renamed settlements. (No "founded 1990"s, no Soviet-era "Kaliningrad"s, and no modern translations of same like "Kaliningrado". Stick with historical "KÃ¶nigsberg", but stop it there, don't try to find some obscure 13th century manuscript with some asinine medieval Low German spelling like "Koanikspeargi".

Rule #1b) Similarly, no "Lunden", no "Franckfurth", etc., at least not for English & Germanic respectively. London & Frankfurt will do just fine. No one wants the mess that is inconsistant, sometime-between-800-and-1800, non-standard-spelling, invariably-sparsely-sourced, "medieval" spellings.

Rule #2) Native Speakers rule. Virtually always, in a disagreement between two individuals regarding the "correct" localised name, the person who speaks the local language natively (fluent before around age 10) wins. Being a native speaker you just have an ear for it. Even if the native speaker just "doesn't like it", and has no replacement, it is better unlocalised than "feeling wrong".

Rule #3) Alt-history names are fine, though preferably only when a true historical name isn't available. French-owned London, England should be Londres, but submitter's choice for London, Ontario.

Rule #4) Keep it consistant. If there are two spelling standards, stick with one of them.

Rule #5) Generally culture group's names should be the largest/most important/most known standard in the group. Russian for East Slavic (hence no specific Russian naming), Castilian for Iberian, etc. (There are a few cases of ambiguity, but generally one culture is much, much larger & better known than all others.)

#Which languages get localised?
15 points - The language is pre-colonial for what is today a colonial-speaking region. (Khoisan for South Africa, Taino for Hispaniola, Iroqouian for Lower Canada, etc. etc. This is typically default... but when it isn't)

10 points - The language is Celtic. BT is the successor to Beyond the Pale and respects its origins with some nominal (flavour & localisation) favourtism. The mod started, way back 6-7? years ago, as an alt-history improvement to the 6 Celtic nations and that flavour is being preserved/expanded upon. (Note - If you don't have a Celtic language already, please make sure you're up to it before suggesting anything. They have some grammar quirks that no other European languages quite "get", and 98% of what you'll find online is just wrong.)

9 points - "I'm a fully fluent native speaker in the language in question." If this is you, we will almost always accept & defer to your expertise.

8 points - The language in question is a major language today, and not the default for its group (Let's say circa 10,000,000 speakers or more. For example: Portuguese or Czech)

7 points - Has contiguous localised naming for all provinces the culture owns at start, as well as *at least* all provinces in the same region *and* all provinces in all directly neighbouring areas (typically +/- 150-250 provinces).

5 points - The culture is not the primary culture of any starting tag in BT pre-1500. If the culture isn't primary for anything, it is generally unoffensive if someone wants to actually do the work involved for the fringe 1/500th of the time it will show up.

4 points - The language in question is a significant language today, and not the default for its group (Over +/- 5,000,000 speakers, including *standardised* modern spellings, and is prestige/functional language of at least a provincial-level government. For example: Danish, Croatian, or Venetian)

2 points - The language in question is a not-insignificant language today (maybe 1,000,000 speakers or more, including *standardised* modern spellings, and is prestige/functional language of at least a provincial-level government. For example: Estonian or Low Saxon)

But:

Minus 2 points - The language is insufficiently organised/documented to have standardised modern spellings. (Most regional Italian languages, a lot of mostly-oral tribal languages, etc.)

Minus 3 points - The person suggesting names is not fluent in the language in question, nor any related language. (There are more languages than BT subscribers, so obviously we'll have to compromise sometimes, but there is a lot of potential for comically serious errors, so if it is already a toss-up, then this probably suggests against.)

Minus 5 points - The language is moribund or extinct *and* closely related to a living language. (For example, Aragonese or Silesian German)

Minus 7 points - The language is close to another major language but violates spelling/orthography rules in a couple provinces without adjusting *all* such provinces. (Mecklenburgian's "Swerin" used, but "Schweinfurt" & "Schleswig" left as is. Galician "A Coruna" used, but colonial "La Romana" not adjusted)
