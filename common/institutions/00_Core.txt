# if a modifier is scaled, its multiplied with development in the province.
# any_friendly_coast_border_province is a special scope made for institution spread.
# It checks for adjacent provinces or provinces one seazone away.
# Friendly is defined as at positive relations or owned by the same country that owns the province.

#Beyond Typus Addon Note -
#Please note that if adding any new tech groups, they will require entries in each institution's embracement speed header, I'd recommend searching 'BT South American Tech Spreads' and adding new entries to the bottom of the list.
#In general, changes are to speed up spread where there have been many new provinces, slow spread in areas that are getting way too much tech in the new system, and use force potential more often, to clean things up for countries who can never obtain the various region specific bonuses
#Note BT adds many new provinces to overhauled areas, but also lowers the average development of those provinces (Tags have the same total dev spread over more provinces). As institutions spread from province to province scaled to dev, this means without changes, institution spread will be markedly slower
#than in vanilla. This is the justification for speeding up spreads.

#One of the largest and most drastic changes here is halving the AI factor for embracement, making the AI wait until the price is lower (i.e. institution has spread to more provinces) before embracing. The logic follows.
#Vanilla system (at least with BT dev, not sure about vanilla) has countries embracing new institutions immediately once one, two, or rarely three provinces embrace the institution, even for large-ish countries like Spain, England, and Austria. This will hopefully encourage countries to wait until it has spread
#a bit more. Ideally, I'd like to see countries embrace when between 1/4 and 1/2 of their provinces already accept the institution, not every single province, and not just their one richest city, but a moderate portion of the nation.

#Tech group list for reference below. As/if I add new groups I'll try to add them here as well.

		###Start of BT Tech group specific spread modifiers - new_world_i   I can't really say I understand what is with the secondary modifer... so it just hits if there is a port, but doesn't slow down if the owner isn't the same, yeah... I'm just reverting to the same system as all the other institutions. Different owner half speed but it hits all provinces, not just ports. There is even a vanilla tooltip for it this already, unused, as far as I can tell.

		#BTAddOn note - Bunch of new spread factors for the Enlightenment. Note they are mostly country-wide, unlike vanilla, all scaled, unlike vanilla, all very slow, unlike vanilla, and generally a huge departure from the way it previously spread. I didn't really like vanilla spread here, hopefully this improves it...
		#I expect, generally, that the enlightenment will be embraced more slowly, but also at lower cost and by more countries by the end of the 18th century. I expect there will also be a somewhat larger divide between richer areas and poorer areas, due to the introduction of scaling. All this is intentional.
		#First two modifers are western tech only, and will hopefully see the Enlightenment spreading historically throughout Western Europe and America. The 3rd through 5th are advisor related spreads requiring manufacturies. 6th and 7th are from ideas and require at least global trade, and 8th is a all 5 or above leader
		#based bonus which everyone is eligible for. Hopefully this mix of requirements will keep everyone growing, but the right ones growing fast. Also will allow a clever player with a focus on tech to bring a normally uncompetitive tech group forward and compete, albeit with varying degrees of difficulty.
		#A 40 dev province with an uni owned by a great power with a lvl 3 natural scientist and both innovative and humanist ideas should see the enlightenment in 2-3 years (only slightly slower than vanilla) but spread can theoretically take hundreds of years, too (not hit before end date). Testing required.
