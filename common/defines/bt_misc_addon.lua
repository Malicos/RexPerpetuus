NDefines.NDiplomacy.PO_TRADE_POWER_PRESTIGE = 5			-- BTAddOn changed from 2   This was underpowered and overpriced
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PO_WAR_REPARATIONS_PRESTIGE = 5			-- BTAddOn changed from 2   Now more expensive so increasing bonuses to keep this aspect comparable
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PREPARE_FOR_WAR_COST = 5			-- BTAddOn changed from 10   Just telling an ally be prepared shouldnt cost the same as dragging them into a war of aggression and leaving them with hundreds of thousands of dead
NDefines.NDiplomacy.CALL_TO_ARMS_COST = 20			-- BTAddOn changed from 10   calling an ally into an offensive war was too cheap and when a similar strength tag a player could tie up an ally constantly with wars every 10 years   calling to arms for a WoA should be a big deal   fewer WW0s
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_ANNUL = 20			-- BTAddOn changed from 10   Breaking up alliances wasnt so easy   also in gameplay terms this was exploitable by isolating a target for a later war immediate after truce was up   unfortunately no way to factor in type of annulment alliance or access
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_WAR_REPARATIONS = 20			-- BTAddOn changed from 10   Used to be a no brainer usually way more money than demanding cash plus no inflation penalties   Also didnt like this being the same price as concede defeat   paying war rep was a much more drastic step
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_HUMILIATE_RIVAL = 50			-- BTAddOn changed from 40   Truly humiliating a rival was a big deal and administrations would often rather give up anything than grovel or lose face
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_DEMAND_NON_OCCUPIED_PROVINCE_MULT = 1.5			-- BTAddOn changed from 1point1   Hey we just occupied a bunch of your land and wrought havoc all over your country now lets talk peace we want the province we didnt devastate   uh huh   sure
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_DEMAND_CAPITAL_MULT = 2.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 1point2   Countries really dont like giving up their caps   If I understand this right it would take over 100 warscore to annex a capital with over 50 dev for normal CBs forcing vassalisation or other options
NDefines.NDiplomacy.DIP_PORT_FEES = 0.04			-- BTAddOn changed from 01   the many more ports in BT were making these fees a bit absurd   generally coastal overhauls got a few more new provinces than inland ones for a variety of reasons but this is to improve BT specific balance
NDefines.NDiplomacy.NUM_OF_GREAT_POWERS = 10			-- BTAddOn changed from 8   the UI can handle it and the immensely greater number of tags in BT made me think this might be fun

NDefines.NCountry.ABDICATE_RULING_LENGTH_THRESHOLD = 10			-- BTAddOn changed from 20   I see why for game balance reasons this has to be high but too many historical kings abdicated after a short period for me to not lower this
NDefines.NCountry.DISINHERIT_PRESTIGE_HIT = -30			-- BTAddOn changed from minus50   I see why for game balance reasons this has to be high but minus 50 is just a little too intense
NDefines.NCountry.ALLOW_ESTATE_AND_PARLIAMENT_SEAT_IN_PROVINCE = 1			-- BTAddOn changed   I see no reason to prevent this
NDefines.NCountry.PS_CHANGE_CULTURE_OVERSEAS_RELIGION_MOD = -0.25			-- BTAddOn changed from minus08   Im not sure I understand when this takes effect but it seems unpredictable and potentially OPed so Im making the bonus less dramatic
NDefines.NCountry.COLONIAL_NATION_GROWTH_IMPACT = 0.5			-- 025 to 05 This is a huge change   Colonies being able to grow themselves twice as fast will result in much faster colonisation and is an important factor in BT balance   Historically colonists expanded the new frontier not the Old World
NDefines.NCountry.NEIGHBOURBONUS = -0.025			-- With the new institution tech system these neighbour bonuses have become way too powerful   after a few decades of neighbouring a coloniser anyone can match max tech in the world   reducing from 5 percent to 2 and a half percent for a start
NDefines.NCountry.NEIGHBOURBONUS_CAP = -0.5			-- As above  I know many people have strong feelings about tech groups which is why Im making my tech overhaul part of an addon   reducing max from 75 percent which was 15 techs behind to 50 percent which will be 20 techs behind
NDefines.NCountry.PS_BUY_IDEA = 300			-- BTAddOn changed from 400   Trying this out on a temp basis to see how it goes   it was pointed out to me that 400 per idea really penalises and slows the corresponding tech which doesn't make sense   if the nation is working on mil ideas shouldnt mil tech keep up too
NDefines.NCountry.PS_FORCE_MARCH = 1			-- BTAddOn changed from 2   Way more provinces in BT so cost of forced march should naturally be lower
NDefines.NCountry.PS_ARTILLERY_BARRAGE = 30			-- BTAddOn changed from 50   Far more proivinces in BT and even more forts   so reducing this slightly
NDefines.NCountry.PS_MOVE_CAPITAL = 100			-- BTAddOn changed from 200   I feel this was a tad overpriced
NDefines.NCountry.CORE_HAD_PERMANENT_CLAIM = 0.1			-- BTAddOn changed from 025   patch 1 25 broke balance hard   permanent claims everywhere left everyone swimming in adm points and exapanding far too fast way too cheaply   trying this on Dubs suggestion to bring balance slightly more in line
NDefines.NCountry.UNREST_REVOLT_FACTOR = 0.4			-- BTAddOn changed from 05   trying to balance the greater unrest from the greater number of provinces
NDefines.NCountry.ABANDON_CORE_PRESTIGE = -5			-- BTAddOn changed from minus10   Was too expensive considering how many more provinces there are
NDefines.NCountry.ABANDON_IDEAGROUP_REFUND = 0.20			-- BTAddOn changed from 010   want to make switching ideas late game slightly more feasible
NDefines.NCountry.REVOLT_SIZE_BASE = 2			-- BTAddOn changed from 4   the many new provinces were causing rebellions to be somwhat OPed   so Im reducing the base size
NDefines.NCountry.INNOVATIVENESS_FIRST_REACHED_TECH_LEVEL = 3.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 2p0   Trying to make being ahead of time somewhat more useful
NDefines.NCountry.INNOVATIVENESS_FIRST_PICKED_IDEA = 2.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 1p0   Trying to make being ahead of time somewhat more useful
NDefines.NCountry.INNOVATIVENESS_BEHIND_IN_TECH_PENALTY = -0.1			-- BTAddOn changed from 0p03   Trying to make being ahead of time somewhat more useful
NDefines.NCountry.INNOVATIVENESS_AHEAD_OF_TIME_BONUS = 0.01			-- BTAddOn changed from 0p005   Trying to make being ahead of time somewhat more useful
NDefines.NCountry.INNOVATIVENESS_DAYS_AFTER_FIRST_PICK_VIABLE = 120			-- BTAddOn changed from 90   More tags to compete with and I see no reason not to extend it a bit so a few more tags get the bonus
NDefines.NCountry.PS_NAVAL_BARRAGE = 25 -- From 50 vanilla, Misc adjusts artillery barrage down to 30, and I figured there'd be a strategic advantage to naval barrage, since you're practically guaranteed to have cannons by the time you want to spend mil points on barraging forts.

NDefines.NEconomy.TRADE_CAPITAL_POWER = 5.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 5p0   Im seeing a lot of numbers I dont really like and I think this might help things along a bit   Well see how it goes
NDefines.NEconomy.CARAVAN_FACTOR = 25.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 3p0   Im seeing a lot of numbers I dont really like and I think this might help things along a bit   Well see how it goes
NDefines.NEconomy.CARAVAN_POWER_MAX = 30			-- BTAddOn changed from 50   Making English Channel the only end node resulted in too much wealth being pulled downstream   Experimenting with lowered caravan power to solve this

NDefines.NMilitary.NATIVE_UPRISING_COOLDOWN_MONTHS = 60			-- BTAddOn changed from 12   Increased chance of native revolts make them more likely but we dont want them ever hitting twice in a row
NDefines.NMilitary.ASSAULT_DEFENDER_LOSS = 0.1			-- BTAddOn changed from 005   This was waaay too much an army of 30000 could be absolutely slaughtered by a garison of 2000   Heroic last stands aside defenders already get a plus5 to rolls   minus 95percent damage it too much 90 is enough
NDefines.NMilitary.INFANTRY_TIME = 90			-- BTAddOn changed from 60   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.CAVALRY_TIME = 135			-- BTAddOn changed from 90   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.ARTILLERY_TIME = 180			-- BTAddOn changed from 120   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.HEAVY_SHIP_TIME = 1095			-- BTAddOn changed from 730   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.LIGHT_SHIP_TIME = 730			-- BTAddOn changed from 365   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.GALLEY_TIME = 730			-- BTAddOn changed from 365   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.TRANSPORT_TIME = 730			-- BTAddOn changed from 365   Far more provinces and a few changes to recruit speed made  it possible to build far too large an army far too quickly   increasing recruiting times for land by 50 percent and sea by 100 percent
NDefines.NMilitary.SUPPLYLIMIT_BASE_MULTIPLIER = 3.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 60   As part of a wider and more comprehensive overhaul of supply limits
NDefines.NMilitary.COMBAT_DICE_SIDE = 7			-- BTAddOn changed from 10   This is a massive change and some people might not like it but I personally was getting fed up with losing and winning mostly losing sure things due to 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 rolls   This makes battles much much less random
NDefines.NMilitary.FORT_FLIPPING_TIME = 60			-- BTAddOn changed from 30   Just because this annoys me   just a personal thing
NDefines.NMilitary.STACKWIPE_MANPOWER_RETURN_FRACTION = 0.1			-- BTAddOn changed from 05   This is brutal but war is brutal   In this period of forced service a regiment completely annihilated in batttle didnt mean half the dead show up in the capital the next day to say hey what next
NDefines.NMilitary.LEADER_GAIN_PERSONALITY_BASE_CHANCE = 30.0			-- BTAddOn changed from 20   Often seeing even active generals without personalities

NDefines.NReligion.MAX_CHRISTIAN_RELIGIOUS_CENTERS = 5			-- BTAddOn changed from 3   Compensating for more provinces and more tags   Ive seen too many games with only 3 protestant and reformed countries because all CoR hit in the same area   Apparently doesnt work leaving it anyway
NDefines.NReligion.MAX_RELIGIOUS_CENTER_SPREAD_DISTANCE = 120			-- BTAddOn changed from 150   this was way too far for CoRs to be spreading   There are more CoRs now so the range can be reduced   Apparently CoR capped at 3 so changing this back to 120
