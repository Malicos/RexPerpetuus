#Beyond Typus formerly replaced 00_government_names, using the changes from HR's original BtP, but between Paradox actually finally getting their ... together in 1.25 for Ireland
#and me getting tired of updating the file, I'm just cutting the file. The odd instance of French Free Cities will just have to use default names, English Marches will have to use default
#and I'll adjust whatever Irish names need it in localisation replace.
