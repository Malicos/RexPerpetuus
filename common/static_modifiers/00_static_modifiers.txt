#The button can be clicked up to 5 times for for the highest dev province in the state, and the modifiers are not state-wide by default, instead applying to the highest dev province in the state.
#This button can therefore theoretically be clicked any number of times if you dev a province to become highest in the state, and costs 50 reform progress and 50 admin points to click.
