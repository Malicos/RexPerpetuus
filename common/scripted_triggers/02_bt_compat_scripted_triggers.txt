#This file has been created to allow mod addon authors to inject specific code into BT's files without having to alter an entire file.
#By creating a file that injects these particular scripted triggers, while the filename precedes this one alphabetically,
#addon mod authors can ensure compatibility between one another by not having to modify the core file, and can selectively alter scripted triggers within this file.
#Should something in the BT mod proper be moved to this file, please notify the mod authors and it can be done.
