		#Few Notes from Draiocht -
		#I tried to make everything dynamic, like vanilla, while introducing a bit more logic (vanilla had just number of ports, so 20 ports on the Black Sea got a x16 chance...) I also introduced large penalties and bonuses to, hopefully, encourage the historical colonisation dates, (which were tending to be a few years late
		#for Castile and Portugal, but several decades early for everyone else) and also give the bonuses to a few historical colonisers who didn't get modifiers in vanilla (like Scotland, Russia, and Navarra). I decided to add an administrative tech req to almost everything to try to control which idea slot is used for
		#exploration. This may be heavy handed, we'll see, but the intent was to be able to introduce massive bonuses and penalties after or before certain dates, and adm tech seems more organic that simply is_year.
