	# # Vanilla Things that need to go here
	# # - Proposer army strength
	# # - Proposer navy strength
	# # - Ai attitude to proposer
	# # - Proposer is a subject nation
	# # - Nation is a subject nation
	# # - Historical rival
	# # - Common rival
	# # - Royal Marriage
	# # - Nation's opinion about proposer
	# # - Trust
	# # - Allied to proposer's rival
	# # - Proposer allied to rival
	# # - Proposer diplomatic reputation
	# # - Proposer is at war
	# # - Not the same religious group
	# # - Distance between borders (only if attitude is neutral)
	# # - Target nations' ruler is Kind-Hearted
	# # - Proposer is threatened by nation's rival
	# # - Proposer already has a powerful ally
	# # - Same religious school (for Islam nations)
	# # - Religious school relations (for Islam nations)
	# #
	# #
	# # Extra things to add
	# # - Negative points for target being too low development 
	# #	This is for large nations to stop them getting poor allies
	# #	It also should have an out for countries that are trying to get a vassal
	# # - Negative points for target being too high development
	# #	This is for small nations to stop them trying to ally large nations
	# # - Positives for being a good ally
	# #	This is to make the nation pick good alliances. Would increase if the
	# #	target is a great power or is allied to a great power
	# # - Negatives for being too close to the nation
	# #	This is to stop the ai from allying a nation in their path of conquest
	# # - Potential to add modifiers depending on missions completed 
	# #	An example of this would be to 
	# # - Add modifiers to the Emperor of the HRE and nations who have at least 1 HRE vote
	# #	This allows smart alliances to get more intelligent HRE nations
	# # - Positive points for potential diplomatic vassalisation targets
	# # - Negative points for low manpower
	# # - Negative points for low forcelimit percent
	# # - Negative points for disaster
	# # - Negative points for occupied provinces (rebel or war)
	# # - Negative points for war exhaustion
	# # - Negative points for loans
	# # - Positive points for large treasury size
