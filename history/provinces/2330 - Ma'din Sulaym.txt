capital = "Hajur"			#Vanilla Ma'din Sulaym was way to far north to be in this province, and I could find no historical info on any settlement in the region, but we don't want Mecca or Medina this long and skinny, so adding a province and just picking a name here
trade_goods = gold			#The Mahd adh Dhahab. Not really active in this period (c. 3000 bc, then c. 750-1250, then again in the 1970s) but this was the only major source of gold in Arabia, so going with it
