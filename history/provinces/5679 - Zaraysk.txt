#1503.4.1 = {}	#Paradox date for Moscovy becoming Russia. I'm not actually 100 percent sure what Paradox is on about here, and feel like I must be missing something, but as I can't figure out what it is, I'm going with the 1547 date. There were terms like Gospodar or Hetman of all Rus', but 'Russia' itself came later.
