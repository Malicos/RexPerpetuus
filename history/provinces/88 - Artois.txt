#Draiocht note - Wow, Artois is much more detailed than the rest of the Low Countries... still, making it consistant by copying the others. The + and - unrest every 2 years also isn't strictly speaking that important. Might add a proper revolt for the Beeldenstorm later though, but based in Brugge, probably.

#Draiocht note - Base files say 'Flanders incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire' in 1548. I can neither easily find info on this, nor disprove it, unless it is refering to the 'Pragmatic Sanction of 1549'. While it is true that this act centralised the Low Countries and organised them within a HRE structure, it also appears to have explicitly outlined the Low Countries as 'not part of the HRE'.
