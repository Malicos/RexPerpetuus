capital = "Den Haag"#The Hague became the de jure capital of Holland around the late 13th century, and the de facto capital by 1358, though it remained barely a village, and not have city rights until 1806. Though technically a capital, it was clearly subservient to the major centres of Brabant and Flanders, and very much in the shadow of nearby Leiden, which was considerably larger until circa late 1700s.
