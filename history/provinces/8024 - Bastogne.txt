culture = wallonian			#Not perfectly clear. Might have been Walloon like the west, or German (Luxumbourgish) like the east... or most likely some mix of the two. By the first reliable information, it is strongly Walloon however, contrary to Arlon which was strongly German, and some mentions of it discuss it as being a cultural centre of Walloonia. So calling it Walloon, even if border is a bit jumpy.

trade_goods = naval_supplies			#Niki says livestock, which is a very valid choice, but I'm making it naval supplies... not much of this is Low Countries and I want a couple, and the area is know for 'forest products'. Plus the eye should be drawn to all the livestock in lower Dutch regions, so no livestock here highlights that a bit.
