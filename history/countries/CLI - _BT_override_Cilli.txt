#Note from Draiocht: I don't actually know whose work this is below. It 'appeared' in BT unofficial and wasn't signed.

#Since they're slovenian culture, I have elected to use Slovenian names for their dynasty and names.
#Summary from what I've gathered:

#Ulrik II (Ulrich II)		16 February 1406 – 9 November 1456	1454-1456										Kantakuzina Katarina Brankovic
