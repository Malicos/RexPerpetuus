capital = 233	# Tintagel Castle of Arthurian myth. 242 would also be a good choice based on its arguable position as capital of pre-Christian Britain. 172 in Brittany has by far the most dev, but is on the fringe and more French than Celtic. 236 (London) would also work, but was long Anglo-Saxon at this point.
