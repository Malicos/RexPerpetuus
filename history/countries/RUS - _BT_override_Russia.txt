#1503.3.22 is Paradox date for Moscovy becoming Russia. I'm not actually 100 percent sure what Paradox is on about here, and feel like I must be missing something, but as I can't figure out what it is.
#I also asked around with some well informed specialists... no one seems to know why March 1503 was picked. I'm going with the 1547 date. There were terms like Gospodar or Hetman of all Rus', but 'Russia' itself came later.

1547.4.16 = { changed_tag_from = MOS }			#BT moves the date of the formation of Russia. Ivan IV (the Terrible) crowned 'Tsar of all Russians'
