#Hopefully for the ease of translators, starting with BT12.0 I'm putting all new localisation content in a new file, which will then be deleted and replaced in the following version (its contents moved to their proper place in the existing files).
#I think it also may help me, as well, to better keep track of changes & miss fewer localisations with new content.

Though generally not as productive as grains for feeding large numbers of people, fruits often provide crucial vitamins otherwise lacking in grain-based diets and provide a welcome sweetness in addition to being easily stored in the form of jams & preserves."          #Sloppy job, might fix later

 bt_trade_good_apicultureDESC:0 "Apiculture, or the raising of domesticated bees and harvesting of bee-related products, dates back thousands of years. Originating in Egypt in distant antiquity and later spreading throughout the world, beekeeping produces both wax and honey, finding such diversified uses as the production of candles, mead, letter-seals, and of course, honey for human consumption."          #Sloppy job, might fix later

 #Decisions
 bt_italian_maritime_republic_merchant_enclaves_title:0 "Invest in Mediterranean Trade"
 bt_italian_maritime_republic_merchant_enclaves_desc:0 "As a preeminent Maritime Republic, we have long flexed our might in the realm of Mediterranean trade, but with a concerted effort we can take this a step further. By removing the tax on certain goods and reinvesting the tax on others we should be able to virtually monopolize several trade routes in the eastern Mediterranean near our enclaves, and ensure the goods find their way into our ports, not those of our rivals."
 
 
 #Province modifiers
 bt_amber_coast:0 "Amber Coast"
 desc_bt_amber_coast:0 "The Sambian Peninsula, occasionally called the 'Amber Coast', is the world's primary source of Amber. Mentioned specifically as early as the year 98 by the Roman historian Tacitus,  'Baltic Amber', as it is known, is so particularly abundant in the area that it washes up on the shoreline all on its own. The semi-precious stone is so abundant that despite being collected since distant antiquity, production continued to increase to the point that by the 18th century, it is believe that 95% of all finshed amber produced worldwide originated from this region."
 bt_super_cows:0 "Friesian Cattle"
 desc_bt_super_cows:0 "The people of the small grassy islands of northwestern Europe were long known for their pastoral expertise, raising large and productive white dairy cattle since antiquity. Starting around the 13th century, Frisians began elevating this expertise to a whole new level, using selective breeding and millennia of experience to produce the most productive breed of cattle in the world. The result was a typically black and white piebald animal which proved extremely productive, producing a large share of Europe's beef, milk, & cheese."
 bt_brauhaus_der_hansa:0 "Brewery of the Hansa"
 desc_bt_brauhaus_der_hansa:0 "The northern coast of Germany came to be know for its beer production, and none more so than Hamburg. Fondly called the 'Hansa's Brewery', the city's brewers were some of the first to use hops, rather than fruit, in the brewing process, and the resulting drink was so popular that it earned the city its nickname. From humble beginning in the 1200s with a few small operations, the city would grow to contain 500 breweries by the middle of the 16th century, supplying much of northern Europe with the finest beer."
 bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Granary of the North"
 desc_bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula positions it ideal to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly tranformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."

 #desc_bt_cloth_house_of_ypres:0 "Currently unused modifier potentially for Ypres"
 bt_wines_of_bordeaux:0 "Claret of Bordeaux"
 desc_bt_wines_of_bordeaux:0 "Winemaking was first introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, but it wasn't until the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1089 that wine production began in earnest. Following the marriage, the Aquitaine region suddenly found itself within the sprawling Angevin Empire, which had a strong taste for quality wine but little other land suitable for intensive viticulture. As a result, the industry was heavily developed and by the mid 1100s Bordeaux was already exporting vast quantities of wine, most commonly a rosé known as 'claret', to northwestern Europe."
 bt_basque_whaling:0 "Basque Whaling"
 desc_bt_basque_whaling:0 "The Basque were the first in the world to hunt whales commercially, and the most successful by far until the 18th century. The burgeoning industry was centered primaily along the Basque coast, especially around San Sebastián, which was first granted whaling rights in 1150. By the 15th century there were about 50 'land factories' all along the Atlantic coast, where Basque sailors rented land to flense and butcher their catch."
 bt_queen_of_the_hansa:0 "Queen of the Hansa"          #Currently unused. Might readd, not sure. 
 desc_bt_queen_of_the_hansa:0 "Lübeck, occasionally known as the 'the Queen of the Hansa', rose from humble beginnings to become the de facto capital of the Hanseatic Lague, and primary trading hub for all of northern Europe, by the middle of the 14th century."
 bt_la_beauce:0 "La Beauce"
 desc_bt_la_beauce:0 "The Beauce is a large natural region in northern France noted for its particularly fertile soil and abundant harvests. The flat, fertile region, quite possibly the most productive in all of Europe, is responsible for a large share of France's grain production, and its historical centre in Chartres is a major grain exporter."
 bt_mercury_of_almaden:0 "Mines of Almadén"
 desc_bt_mercury_of_almaden:0 "Almadén is home to the world's largest reserves of cinnabar and mercury. First mined by the Romans, the seemingly inexhaustible supply would later become of vital importance as mercury was discovered to be vital in a new process of extracting pure gold or silver from raw ore."
