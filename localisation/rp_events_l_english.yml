 #Norwegian Events

 norway.1.t:0 "The Denlegian Question"
 norway.1.d:0 "Although England did not stay under Norwegian rule, some Nordurican families have managed to stay on the Northern Isles and keep their holds. Among those holds is our ally Jorvik. Threatened by growing neighboring powers, they are once again looking for our protection."
 norway.1.a:0 "They are wise to swear fealty to us!"
 norway.1.b:0 "We will manage without them."

 norway.2.t:0 "The Kingdom of Galway"
 norway.2.d:0 "The Gallwegians are of Nordurican descent like us, and they lived on Ireland as a minority. Over time, they developed their own system which let them hold onto the cities - with a strong burgher class and a ruler elected for life instead of inheriting the throne. Now, as the new protectors of Ireland, we have a chance to finally create a unified kingdom for them. It is on us to decide how much autonomy they are allowed to have."
 norway.2.a:0 "They will have some autonomy."
 norway.2.b:0 "Galway will become our crownland."

 waroftheravens.1.t:0 "Assassination of Alv Hardrada"
 waroftheravens.1.d:0 "The Hardrada family has ruled Norway for centuries. In 1066, King Harald Hardrada conquered England and defeated the Norman invaders led by William the Bastard. However, none of his descendants shared his greatness. The throne of England was soon lost by the family, and Norway has been in constant stagnation since then. Now in 1445, a succesful plot has eliminated the last Hardrada - King Alv. The strongest claim belongs to Severin, head of house Staur, a cadet branch of Hardradas. However, young and ambitious Halvard Hjerne, who orchestrated the plot, has gathered a large support among Norwegian nobles and will not give up the throne without a fight."
 waroftheravens.1.a:0 "Severin Staur is the rightful ruler."
 waroftheravens.1.b:0 "Halvard Hjerne will lead us to greatness."
