 #Denlegian Events

 jorvik.1.t:0 "Jorvik - an unavoidable collapse?"
 jorvik.1.d:0 "Since overseas Nodic powers left England, an independent Kingdom of Danelaw remained as the last bastion of Viking ways. However, disunited and without foreign support, the country was left weak and has since then lost its southern territories to its Anglo-Saxon neighbors. Now the King in Jorvik is only left with his small crownland and a rebellious state of Bernicia to the north, which is tired of paying taxes and fighting for their weak ruler and seeks self governance. With forces far greater than those of the capital it will take tremendous effort to maintain their loyalty."
