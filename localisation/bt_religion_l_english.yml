This tree was important to Oromo mythology and was important to the Oromo themselves during the Oromo Migrations. Another tree that was important was the Acacia Tree (or ‘Garbii’). Other symbols included cows and water, as that is where Waaq was born. What sets this apart from other African religions was monotheism, rather than polytheism. Waaq was also tied to the Gadaa system, where Waaq would play a part in the rituals and government’s decisions."
