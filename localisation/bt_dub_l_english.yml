Unfortunately, help did not reach the city in time, and as a result, over 80% of its inhabitants were slaughtered and raped by its attackers. This event, known as the Sacking of Magdeburg, has coined the term \"Magdeburgization\", meaning total destruction.\n\nIt did not take long however for the city to once again prosper, however, as its Burgmeister and scientist Otto von Guericke amassed personal wealth as a brewer which he himself spent on restoring the city to its former glory. While it did not reach its prior importance until much later, it served as an important stepping stone towards that recovery."

With them, Otto von Guericke coined the concept of atmospheric pressure and, with an air pump, the existence of vacuum. Being unable to be torn apart by even the power of thirty horses, the Magdeburg Hemispheres were a marvellous demonstration of the powers of science and invention."

 BeyondTypusCarpathiaPolandEvents.2.desc:0 "In 1412 after constant warring with the Ottomans, the Kingdom of Hungary was in fiscal peril. Having spent massive amounts on the war efforts, they looked to their northern brethren, the Polish, for help. And so, the Treaty of Lubowla was negotiated, stipulating the Polish grant the Kingdom of Hungary a loan of \"sixty times the amount of 37,000 Prague groschen\", or about seven tonnes of pure silver. In exchange, Hungary pawned 16 salt-producing towns in the Szepes county to Poland. Hungary never managed to pay back the loan, and instead in 1489, Hungary tried to take the area back by force. This lead to the township, now known as the Eldership of Spisz, being incorporated into the Crown of Poland, only being regained by Maria Theresa for Hungary in 1772, as part of the Partitions of Poland."
