Niklot would fall in his quest of resistance against the Saxons, and his son Pribislav would accept German suzerainty. Three hundred years later, Niklot's family still reigns over Mecklenburg."
 partitions_of_meck:0 "Partitions of Mecklenburg"
 partitions_of_meck_desc:0 "The possesions of Mecklenburg would be partitioned three times in it's history. The first time in 1234, second in 1621, and lastly in 1701. These divisions were always due to the same issues with inheritance. We should seek to prevent future division."
 mkl_crown_of_sweden:0 "Crown of Sweden"

 mkl_grand_duchy:0 "Grand Duchy"
 mkl_grand_duchy_desc:0 "We must seek to elevate our status within the Empire. Our lands have been home to multiple sub-duchies, cadet branches, and claims to foreign titles. Raising our feudal rank to Grand Duchy would be much more accurate for a state of our importance."

 SBG_ideas_bonus:0 "Siebenbürger Ambition"
 SBG_idea_2:0 "Continue the Ostsiedlung"

 SBG_idea_3:0 "Kirchenburgen"
 SBG_idea_3_desc:0 "Fortified monasteries, walled churches, and impressive castles are prevelant throughout the Siebenbürgen. Often known as 'Kirchenburgen', they have become symbols of our local culture. We shall continue to guard the frontier as King Géza II asked of us, no matter the cost."
 SBG_idea_4:0 "Diploma Andreanum"
 SBG_idea_4_desc:0 "The Diploma Andreanum, also known as the Golden Charter of the Translyvanian Saxons, was a statute issued and reaffirmed by the Kings of Hungary. This law granted privileges to the German colonists, guaranteing local loyalty."
 SBG_idea_5:0 "Johannes Honterus"

 SBG_idea_6:0 "Rumäniendeutsche"
 SBG_idea_6_desc:0 "The Translyvanian Saxons are far from the only Germans to settle within the region of Romania. Over the centuries, more and more Germans (and even some French and Switzers) would settle in other places, such as Bukovina, Banat, and Bessarabia. We welcome these new arrivals!"
 SBG_idea_7:0 "Indiscriminant Commercialism"
 SBG_idea_7_desc:0 "Despite the often violent political nature of the Balkans, we have earned a reputation as thrifty traders and sophisticated consumers.

 CUM_idea_1:0 "Settle the Cunság"

 CUM_idea_2:0 "Baptism of Köten"
 CUM_idea_2_desc:0 "In exchange for refuge in Hungary, our leader, Khan Köten, was required to convert to Christianity. Thousands of other Cuman refugees followed his lead and have became proud Catholics. Today we proudly celebrate our conversion, and shall further spread our faith should the opportunity arise."
 CUM_idea_3:0 "Elizabeth the Cuman"
 CUM_idea_3_desc:0 "Khan Köten's daughter, Elizabeth, would be bethrothed to the heir of the Kingdom of Hungary. Elizabeth would go on the become Queen, and later Regent of the realm. She was highly influential in the court life of this country and would spread Cuman culture to the forefront of royal living."
 CUM_idea_4:0 "Iudex Cumanorum"
 CUM_idea_4_desc:0 "The Iudex Cumanorum, or Judge of the Cumans, was a traditional and ceremonial title for the second most powerful man in Hungary, the Royal Palatine. We should reform the title in order to dictate law and settle disputes in Cumania."
 CUM_idea_5:0 "Cuman Auxiliaries"
 CUM_idea_5_desc:0 "The primary obilgation of the Cumans in Hungary was to serve as light cavalry whenever required. This we have done, and we have earned a reputation as fierce and skilled combatants because of it."
 CUM_idea_6:0 "Counter the Nobility"
 CUM_idea_6_desc:0 "The Cumans and the Hungarian nobility were bitter rivals and would often compete for Royal favor. Both sides severely distrusted each other and political scheming and assassination were not uncommon. We must put an end to this petty bickering and triumph over the nobles if we are to succeed."
 CUM_idea_7:0 "Vanguard of the Turkish Wars"
 CUM_idea_7_desc:0 "The lands of the Cumans would be devastated in a series of conflicts between the Habsburg domains and the Ottoman Empire. Our territory and population would never return to their prewar strength, but our service and sacrifice was integral to both the Habsburgs and all of Christendom."
 SZE_ideas:0 "Székely Ideas"
 SZE_ideas_start:0 "Székely Traditions"
 SZE_ideas_bonus:0 "Székely Ambition"
 SZE_idea_1:0 "Sceculzaz Centurionatus"
 SZE_idea_1_desc:0 "The Székely people have their origins as frontiersmen turned warriors. We have served the Kings of Hungary as light infantry, as able guardsmen, and as marcher lords. Although the frontier may change, we always remain steadfast."
 SZE_idea_2:0 "Count of the Székelys"
 SZE_idea_2_desc:0 "The highest ranking royal official in Székelyland was the Count of the Székelys. These counts didn't necessarily rule over the land, but instead lead local troops, held judicial authority, and acted as a direct representative of the King. They would also seek to curb our autonomy whenever they saw fit."
 SZE_idea_3:0 "Hunnic Connections?"
 SZE_idea_3_desc:0 "The true cultural and ethnic origin of the Székely is not known to us, but many theories have been circulating. Some scholars claim that we descend from the great conqueror Attila! Or perhaps our predecessors were a Magyarized Turkic band like the Khavars. Whatever our heritage may be, we should seek to enthuastically promote it!"
 SZE_idea_4:0 "The Széks"
 SZE_idea_4_desc:0 "Szék are special administrative regions within Hungary that are very autonomous and acted outside of the feudal system of land ownership. Autonomy can be a versatile tool, possibly even a profitable tool. When the people stand something to gain, they tend to do better in their labour. Who knew?"
 SZE_idea_5:0 "Runic Script"
 SZE_idea_5_desc:0 "The Old Hungarian writing script was officially replaced by the Latin Script when the Magyars settled down. However, the old runes remain in some general use in the Székelyland. We should encourage it's use amoungst our artists and great thinkers, perhaps even sparking a Runic Renaissance."
 SZE_idea_6:0 "Defend our Privleges"
 SZE_idea_6_desc:0 "Most of Hungary would succumb to Ottoman suzerainty during the 16th century, and although the Székely would resist fiercely, they would fall as well. In order to preserve their privleges and livelihoods, the people would thake a much more provacative anti-Ottoman policy. Revolts and protests became much more common."
 SZE_idea_7:0 "Remember the Siculicidium"
 SZE_idea_7_desc:0 "Siculicidium translates to "murder of the Székelys" and refers to a specific massacre in 1764. This terrible assault occured as a result of our kin protesting Habsburg incursions into our very old and long affirmed land rights. The Siculicidium would be burned in our social consciousness, and encourage future support for liberty seeking people everywhere."

 JER_ideas_start:0 "Channel Islands Traditions"
 JER_ideas_bonus:0 "Channel Islands Ambition"
 jer_castles:0 "Castle Cornet & Mont Orgueil"
 jer_castles_desc:0 "The Channel Islands are home to several castles in various states of use or disrepair. Two of the most impressive are Castle Cornet and Mont Orgueil on Guernsey and Jersey respectively. Although they are starting to show their age, they have withstood many a French siege. Let us hope for many more!"
 jer_states_assembly:0 "Êtats d'Jèrri"
 jer_states_assembly_desc:0 "The Êtats d'Jèrri, or States Assembly, is the legislative body of the Bailiwick of Jersey. According to legend, they have been in existence since the reign of King John, when he ratified the Norman Law of the Channel Islands. Successive English monarchs would all reaffirm Jersey's charter to govern herself."
 jer_settle_sark:0 "Settle Sark"
 jer_settle_sark_desc:0 "Currently, the Isle of Sark is an underdeveloped refuge of bandits and scallywags. We should lease this land to more reputable folk who will build up new settlements within our Bailiwick."
 jer_land_grants:0 "Carteret Land Grants"
 jer_land_grants_desc:0 "Sir George Carteret was a prominent Royalist from Jersey during the English Civil War. His support for the Crown during trying times gave him great influence in the Royal Court. In recognition for his service, he recieved a large grant of land in the New World, which he would name New Jersey."
 jer_jerriais_guerriesais:0 "Jerriais & Guerriesais"
 jer_jerriais_guerriesais_desc:0 "Both the islands of Jersey and Guernsey have local dialects of the Norman language. Known as Jerriais and Guerriesais, these dialects remind us of our mixed Anglo-French and Scandinavian heritage."
 jer_neutral_trade:0 "Nonpartisan Trade"
 jer_neutral_trade_desc:0 "Our abnormal political situation allows us to be the middleman of trade between continental Europe and Britain. We should take advantage of this, and establish ourselves as a free and neutral port."
 jer_last_of_normandy:0 "Successor to Normandy"
 jer_last_of_normandy_desc:0 "The dual Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are the last possessions of the Duchy of Normandy. This simple fact has profoundly influenced our society, language, and culture. We hold more legitimate claim to the Ducal Ring than any English or French King!"
 WMC_ideas:0 "Marches Ideas"
 WMC_ideas_start:0 "Marches Traditions"
 WMC_ideas_bonus:0 "Marches Ambition"
 WMC_idea_1:0 "Richard of York, Earl of March"
 WMC_idea_1_desc:0 "Richard of York is the wealthiest and most powerful noble in all of England, second only to the King himself. He would inherit multiple estates over the course of his life, and held a very strong claim to the English throne. Richard's power and claims would be one of the main causes of the War of the Roses."
 WMC_idea_2:0 "Shrewsbury Drapers Company"
 WMC_idea_2_desc:0 "The city of Shrewsbury is well positioned to become an epicenter of cloth production. It's proximity to Wales means that our burghers can purchase and spin Welsh wool in vast quantities. If we form a merchant guild to coordinate our actions, we can establish a monopoly over Welsh wool."
 WMC_idea_3:0 "Marchia Wallie"
 WMC_idea_3_desc:0 "The borderlands between England and Wales have always been contested. Because of this the border has always been fortified, going as far back as King Offa's Dyke. Currently, it is made up of several small Marcher Lordships with what seems like a hundred small castles. Every one of them shall keep raiders out and put down any local insurrection."
 WMC_idea_4:0 "Expand the Market Towns"
 WMC_idea_4_desc:0 "After the establishment of the Welsh Marches, several market towns began to spring up around the new castles. These mercantile cities include Chepstow, Monmouth, and Ludlow. All of them would become beacons of local wealth, and the beginning of large scale English settlement in Wales."
 WMC_idea_5:0 "Law of the March"
 WMC_idea_5_desc:0 "An interesting blend of Welsh Law and English Common Law, the Laws of the March is difficult to understand. The specifics can vary from Lordship to Lordship, and the Law has never been properly codified. We must amend this if we seek to keep our autonomy from the King and to better rule over our subjects."
 WMC_idea_6:0 "Council of Wales and the Marches"
 WMC_idea_6_desc:0 "We should support the creation a regional administrative body, one that represents Wales, the Marcher Lords, and the border counties. This 'Council of Wales and the Marches' will act as a legislature and a court of law, and shall be a paragon of decentralized governance in Wales and Western England."
 WMC_idea_7:0 "Laws in Wales Acts"
 WMC_idea_7_desc:0 "The reign of the Marcher Lords could not last forever. As times changed and England centralized, Parliament would seek to pass the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542. These laws would dissolve the Lordships, incorporate the Principality of Wales into England, and created many new shires out of the existing counties."
 DUR_ideas:0 "Dunelmian Ideas"
 DUR_ideas_start:0 "Dunelmian Traditions"
 DUR_ideas_bonus:0 "Dunelmian Ambition"
 DUR_idea_1:0 "Shrine of Saint Cuthbert"
 DUR_idea_1_desc:0 "Saint Cuthbert was a famous monk, hermit, and one of the first Bishops of Lindisfarne. He was extremely pious, and was highly regarded for his generousity and miracle work. Durham was settled as his final resting place, and carries on his sacred legacy to this day."
 DUR_idea_2:0 "The River Wear"
 DUR_idea_2_desc:0 "The River Wear encircles our hilltop city on three sides, simultaneously protecting Durham and acting as a bloodline of trade. The Wear also flows straight through mining country, allowing ease of movement for stone, lead, and eventually coal from the Pennine Mountains."
 DUR_idea_3:0 "Durham Cathedral"
 DUR_idea_3_desc:0 "Our Cathedral is the result of four centuries of renovations, alterations, and even demolition. What started as a temporary wooden structure has blossomed into a beacon of Gothic and Norman architecture, and remains one of the holiest pilgramage sites in all of England."
 DUR_idea_4:0 "Neville's Cross"
 DUR_idea_4_desc:0 "Immediately west of Durham is Neville's Cross, the site of a grand Battle against the Scottish. During said Battle, an outnumbered English force soundly defeated the Scots, killing one of their Lords and even capturing King David II! Such a resounding victory should always be remembered by Dunelmian commanders."
 DUR_idea_5:0 "Bishop by Divine Providence"
 DUR_idea_5_desc:0 "Legends say that Durham was founded thanks to divine intervention, a vision of Saint Cuthbert instructing Monks to settle upon our hilltop. Whatever you may think of such folk tales, such an esteemed claim greatly reinforces the prestige of our Prince Bishops. While other bishops are appointed in the name of God, we possess direct heavenly favor."
 DUR_idea_6:0 "Neptune of Durham"
 DUR_idea_6_desc:0 "The fires of industry and mercantilism are beginning to spread all over England, and Durham is no different. Wealthy merchants, engineers, and tradespeople are proposing a series of canals to link our fair city to the River Tyne, leading to the North Sea. Such a project would greatly improve Durham's naval potential."
 DUR_idea_7:0 "Non nobis solum"
 DUR_idea_7_desc:0 "We are on the precipice of a new, more enlightened era. Our great castles and Cathedral already house an untold number of manuscripts, chronicles, and even more contemporary written works. We should continue down this path of education and charter a University of Durham, the first of it's kind to open in England in half a millennium."
 GZR_ideas:0 "Gazarian Ideas"
 GZR_ideas_start:0 "Gazarian Traditions"
 GZR_ideas_bonus:0 "Gazarian Ambition"
 GZR_idea_1:0 "Treaty of Nymphaeum"
 GZR_idea_1_desc:0 "The Treaty of Nymphaeum was signed by Genoa and the Empire of Nicaea. In exchange for an alliance against the Venetians, it granted Genoese merchants exclusive trade rights within the Black Sea. Our colonial authority bears the legacy of the Empire of the Romans, and despite the rising Ottoman threat to the south we remain commercially dominant."
 GZR_idea_2:0 "Liber Gazarie"
 GZR_idea_2_desc:0 "The Caffan government is structured with an eight member upper house known as the "Officium Gazarie" and an elected lower house of twenty-four members. Presiding over it all is the annually elected Consul and his advisors appointed from Genoa. All of our colonies are lead in a similar manner, with Caffa being the most prominent among them."
 GZR_idea_3:0 "Steppe Slave Trade"
 GZR_idea_3_desc:0 "The Genoese colonies are home to some of the largest slave markets in the Mediterranean. We do not capture these slaves ourselves, but instead purchase them from the neighboring steppe hordes to be sold at marked up prices abroad. Some back home may rightly object to this, but they forget that we do business in a rough neighborhood where lives can be bought, sold, and lost on the cheap."
 GZR_idea_4:0 "Legacy of the Siege"
 GZR_idea_4_desc:0 "Despite our willingness to trade, relations with the nomads have been hostile in the past and could always return that way. In these uneasy times, we are reminded of the grueling Siege of Caffa. Despite overwhelming odds and the beginning of the Black Plague, we routed the Mongols and forced them to concede."
 GZR_idea_5:0 "Crimean Cosmpolitanism"
 GZR_idea_5_desc:0 "Crimea under our rule has become the crossroads of nations and ideals, it almost seems that all peoples of the Mediterranean can be found here. Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Islam, and Judaism are all practiced within our walls and dozens of languages can be heard at our trading posts."
 GZR_idea_6:0 "Property of the Bank of Saint George"
 GZR_idea_6_desc:0 "After the Fall of Constantinople, the Republic of Genoa began to panic. Her overseas colonies were now in immediate danger from Ottoman expansionism. It would be decided that the Gazaria could no longer be effectively governed from Genoa, and it would be directly ceded to the most powerful bank in Genoa, the Bank of Saint George."
 GZR_idea_7:0 "Ghislofis of Matrega"
 GZR_idea_7_desc:0 "Eventually the Turks would conquer Crimea, but that would not be the end of Gazaria. The De Ghislofi family ruled over the Taman Peninsula from Matrega and would continue to do so after the fall of Caffa. They were quite resourceful and sought assistance both locally from Circassian relatives, and further afield from Muscovy and Genoa."
 GRN_ideas:0 "Groningen Ideas"
 GRN_ideas_start:0 "Groningen Traditions"
 GRN_ideas_bonus:0 "Groningen Ambition"
 GRN_idea_1:0 "Widen the Reitdiep"
 GRN_idea_1_desc:0 "Groningen is connected to the North Sea by the Hunze, a meandering shallow river. Over time the lower parts of the Hunze have been straightened and channeled, allowing for a greater ease of shipping to and from our city. These channels, called the Reitdiep, must be expanded in order to maintain our growing influence as a commercial center."
 GRN_idea_2:0 "Build the Martinitoren"
 GRN_idea_2_desc:0 "The oldest church in Groningen, the Martinikerk, does not have a steeple. We cannot allow this to continue, no other Hanseatic City worth their salt has a steepleless church! We shall begin construction immediately on the Martinitoren, a tower that shall become symbolic of Groningen. And just incase it gets damaged, we'll build it a little bit taller each time!"
 GRN_idea_3:0 "Goudkantoor"
 GRN_idea_3_desc:0 "Collecting taxes can be a difficult business, sometimes even dangerous. As Groningen grows in size this task shall only get harder. We should centralize our collection agencies into a single new building, the Goudkantoor. This will simplify the taxation process, and guarantee that all of Eastern Friesland will render unto Caesar."
 GRN_idea_4:0 "Grönnegs"
 GRN_idea_4_desc:0 "Grönnegs, also known as Gronings, is the unique language of our townspeople. Our dialect is reflective of our surrondings, with Grönnegs being heavily influenced by Low Saxon, Frisian, and Dutch. While we share many similarities with our neighbors, Grönnegs is part of the distinctive identity of our people."
 GRN_idea_5:0 "Wessel Harmensz Gansfort"
 GRN_idea_5_desc:0 "A scholar, a theologian, and a humanist, Wessel Gansfort is one of the most learned men to be from Groningen. He debated at some of the finest universities across Europe, often protesting against Papal authority and abuse of the sacraments. In this era of religious turmoil, we should remember that one of the greatest heralds of the Reformation was from our humble city."
 GRN_idea_6:0 "University of Groningen"
 GRN_idea_6_desc:0 "Inspired by Gansfort, other academics from Groningen have proposed the creation of a University in order to independently study. Such a prestigious institution will not only be a educational boon, but also a tremendous aid to local governance."
 GRN_idea_7:0 "Gronings Ontzet"
 GRN_idea_7_desc:0 "The Gronings Ontzet, or the Relief of Groningen, would be one of the turning points in the Disaster Year of 1672. The Dutch Republic faced enemies on all sides, French from the South, English from the sea, and the Bishopric of Münster from the East. The enemy Prince-Bishop laid seige to Groningen, and it almost looked like all hope was lost. Against all odds, we held out and helped save the Dutch independence!"
 FRL_ideas:0 "Forlivesi Ideas"
 FRL_ideas_start:0 "Forlivesi Traditions"
 FRL_ideas_bonus:0 "Forlivesi Ambition"
 FRL_idea_1:0 "Forum Livii"
 FRL_idea_1_desc:0 "The Livii were an illustious noble family that honorably employeed by the Roman state. Very active during the Republic and early Empire, they produced eight consuls, many historians, and dozens of other important officials. Forli was settled by a famous Livii general who had defended the region during the Second Punic War. Our government should promote a culture of proud service like our ancestral founders!"
 FRL_idea_2:0 "City of Patrons & Saints"
 FRL_idea_2_desc:0 "Forli is unique in Romagna due to it's multiple patrons, saints, and martyrs. This includes Mercurialis, the first Bishop of Forli and alleged dragonslayer, and Peregrine, the patron saint of those suffering from cancer. In addition to our co-patrons is the more recent veneration of the "Madonna of the Fire", a woodcut print of the Virgin Mary that miraculously survived a ravenous blaze."
 FRL_idea_3:0 "Abbey of San Mercuriale"
 FRL_idea_3_desc:0 "Considered a marvel of architecture throughout Romagna, the Abbey of San Mercuriale is famous. It's brick belltower is an icon of our city and one of the tallest in all of Italy. In recent years the Abbey has seen some small renovations, but also has begun to accrue a sizable art collection sponsored by the Lords of Forli."
 FRL_idea_4:0 "Support the Jewish Congress"
 FRL_idea_4_desc:0 "Perhaps surprisingly, Forli is the thriving center of the Jewish community of central Italy. In our city Jews own land, operate a bank, practice as doctors, and create some of the finest Renaissance inspired art and poetry. Presently the Jewry of Forli have amassed delegates from all over Italy in order to reaffirm Jewish privilages and revoke hostile legislation. We should support their efforts."
 FRL_idea_5:0 "Rocca di Ravaldino"
 FRL_idea_5_desc:0 "The Rocca di Ravaldino is the bastion of Forli's defense. There has always been a fort where the Rocca di Ravaldino now stands, and the current iteration has been consistently expanded as time has gone by. It now includes many towers, a keep, three ravelins, and an inner citadel. Such defensive prowess will help us ward off any Papal siege."
 FRL_idea_6:0 "Academy of the Filergiti"
 FRL_idea_6_desc:0 "The Filergiti was a refined institution based out of Forli dedicated to furthering scientific, religious, and literary pursuits. From fine arts and epic poems to agricultural and natural sciences, it's many members were the greatest minds of their age. We should reestablish the Academy to begin a new intellectual awakening, with Forli at it's center."
 FRL_idea_7:0 "Tigress of Forli"
 FRL_idea_7_desc:0 "There is so much to say about Caterina Sforza. She was the fierce last independent Countess of Forli, a staunch defender against Borgia aggression. Caterina was passionate about military affairs, a skilled administrator, and if that wasn't enough she was a mother of eight. All of posterity shall rightly remember her as a beautiful and talented warrior countess, deserving of the title 'Tigress of Forli.'"

 IST_ideas_bonus:0 "Istrian Ambition"
 IST_idea_1:0 "Legacy of the Histri"
 IST_idea_1_desc:0 "The Histri were the ancient tribal inhabitants of Istria, to which they gave the name. Little is known about our distant predecessors except that they were an active naval people, trading along the Adriatic's shores. To the Romans, the Histri were fierce raiders and piratical savages. It took two campaigns to subdue what would become Istria, one of Rome's first stepping stones to empire."
 IST_idea_2:0 "Arena di Pola"
 IST_idea_2_desc:0 "When the Romans annexed Istria, they settled many coastal cities and built many grand structures. One of those such structures is the Arena di Pola, an extremely well preserved classical amphitheatre. Although it's heyday of gladitorial combat has long since ended, the Arena continues to be used as a tournament space, fairground, and local source of stone for construction."
 IST_idea_3:0 "Margraviate of Istria"
 IST_idea_3_desc:0 "Istria was designated a march during the Carolingian Empire, in order to safeguard Italy from migrating tribes and horseback raiders from the steppes. Eventually Charlemagne's empire would be divided amongst his heirs, yet Istria continues to remain a Holy Roman march to this day. Despite the Habsburgs claiming our title, we shall steadfastly remain Italy's eastern bulwark!"
 IST_idea_4:0 "Mitterburg"
 IST_idea_4_desc:0 "Mitterburg is a large castle in the town of Pisino, the administrative center of Habsburg Istria. The Austrians have only recently inherited it, and currently rent it out to various minor noble families that are loyal to them. Our peninsula may be heavily contested, but one thing remains certain: Whoever controls Mitterburg controls the defence of all Istria."
 IST_idea_5:0 "Arsa River"
 IST_idea_5_desc:0 "The Arsa River was used as a border during Roman times, dividing Italy from it's Dalmatian provinces to the east. On occasion the Arsa would continue to act as a border river, but it possesses a unused great bay at it's inlet. Since we control both sides, we should utilize the river for small scale boat and raft traffic, allowing sea trade to reach inland villages that it previously couldn't reach."
 IST_idea_6:0 "Support the Cici"
 IST_idea_6_desc:0 "The Cici, or Cicci, is the local name for the Romanian peoples that have settled Istria's highlands, specifically a region named Cicearia. Traditionally pastoralists and peasants, Cici villages are self sufficient but small. We should support these 'Istro-Romanian' towns in order to integrate them as productive members of our nation."
 IST_idea_7:0 "Pola Naval Yard"
 IST_idea_7_desc:0 "Pola has been a naval city since it's foundation, with shipbuilding and fishing being it's two key industries. Unlike some of our fellow Adriatic towns, we lack a dedicated Naval Yard and Arsenal. This will not suffice any longer. Construction must begin immediately on a series of Martello towers and cannon batteries. We shall catapult Pola into a naval powerhouse!"

 aqu_patriarchate_of_aquileia_desc: "Founded in 539, the Patriarchate of Aquileia was one of the largest independent Italian states at it's height. Few states can claim a history stretching back to Antiquity."
 aqu_aquileian_legacy: "Aquileian Legacy"
 aqu_aquileian_legacy_desc: "Our current borders do not extend to the prior size of the Patriarchate. Simultaneously not all Friulians live within our country, even when we were formerly independent. We must set both of these right."
 aqu_volchero_and_bertrand: "Volchero and Bertrand"
 aqu_volchero_and_bertrand_desc: "In the early 13th century, Aquileia flourished economically and culturally under the patriarchs Volchero and Bertrand. If we remind people of these times we can flourish once more."
