 partitions_of_meck:0 "Partitions of Mecklenburg"
 partitions_of_meck_desc:0 "The possesions of Mecklenburg would be partitioned three times in it's history. The first time in 1234, second in 1621, and lastly in 1701. These divisions were always due to the same issues with inheritance. We should seek to prevent future division."
 mkl_crown_of_sweden:0 "Crown of Sweden"

 mkl_grand_duchy:0 "Grand Duchy"
 mkl_grand_duchy_desc:0 "We must seek to elevate our status within the Empire. Our lands have been home to multiple sub-duchies, cadet branches, and claims to foreign titles. Raising our feudal rank to Grand Duchy would be much more accurate for a state of our importance."

 SBG_ideas_bonus:0 "Siebenbürger Ambition"

 SBG_idea_3:0 "Kirchenburgen"

 SBG_idea_7:0 "Indiscriminant Commercialism"
 SBG_idea_7_desc:0 "Despite the often violent political nature of the Balkans, we have earned a reputation as thrifty traders and sophisticated consumers.

 CUM_idea_2:0 "Baptism of Köten"
 CUM_idea_2_desc:0 "In exchange for refuge in Hungary, our leader, Khan Köten, was required to convert to Christianity.

 CUM_idea_4_desc:0 "The Iudex Cumanorum, or Judge of the Cumans, was a traditional and ceremonial title for the second most powerful man in Hungary, the Royal Palatine. We should reform the title in order to dictate law and settle disputes in Cumania."
 CUM_idea_5:0 "Cuman Auxiliaries"
 CUM_idea_5_desc:0 "The primary obilgation of the Cumans in Hungary was to serve as light cavalry whenever requiered. This we have done, and we have earned a reputation as fierce and skilled combatants because of it."
 CUM_idea_6:0 "Counter the Nobility"
 CUM_idea_6_desc:0 "The Cumans and the Hungarian nobility were bitter rivals and would often compete for Royal favor. Both sides severely distrusted each other and political scheming and assassination were not uncommon. We must put an end to this petty bickering and triumph over the nobles if we are to succeed."

 CUM_idea_7_desc:0 "The lands of the Cumans would be devastated in a series of conflicts between the Habsburg domains and the Ottoman Empire.

 SZE_ideas_bonus:0 "Székely Ambition"
 SZE_idea_1:0 "Sceculzaz Centurionatus"

 SZE_idea_2:0 "Count of the Székelys"
 SZE_idea_2_desc:0 "The highest ranking royal official in Székelyland was the Count of the Székelys.

 SZE_idea_3:0 "Hunnic Connections?"
 SZE_idea_3_desc:0 "The true cultural and ethnic origin of the Székely is not known to us, but many theories have been circulating.

 SZE_idea_4:0 "The Széks"
 SZE_idea_4_desc:0 "Szék are special administrative regions within Hungary that are very autonomous and acted outside of the feudal system of land ownership. Autonomy can be a versatile tool, possibly even a profitable tool. When the people stand something to gain, they tend to do better in their labour. Who knew?"
 SZE_idea_5:0 "Runic Script"
 SZE_idea_5_desc:0 "The Old Hungarian writing script was officially replaced by the Latin Script when the Magyars settled down. However, the old runes remain in some general use in the Székelyland.

 SZE_idea_6:0 "Defend our Privleges"
 SZE_idea_6_desc:0 "Most of Hungary would succumb to Ottoman suzerainty during the 16th century, and although the Székely would resist fiercely, they would fall as well.

 SZE_idea_7:0 "Remember the Siculicidium"
 SZE_idea_7_desc:0 "Siculicidium translates to "murder of the Székelys" and refers to a specific massacre in 1764.

This event would be burned in our social consciousness, and encourage future support for liberty seeking people everywhere."

 jer_castles:0 "Castle Cornet & Mont Orgueil"
 jer_castles_desc:0 "The Channel Islands are home to several castles in various states of use or disrepair. Two of the most impressive are Castle Cornet and Mont Orgueil on Guernsey and Jersey respectively. Although they are starting to show their age, they have withstood many a French siege. Let us hope for many more!"
 jer_states_assembly:0 "Êtats d'Jèrri"
 jer_states_assembly_desc:0 "The Êtats d'Jèrri, or States Assembly, is the legislative body of the Bailiwick of Jersey.

 jer_last_of_normandy:0 "Successor to Normandy"
 jer_last_of_normandy_desc:0 "The dual Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are the last possessions of the Duchy of Normandy. This simple fact has profoundly influenced our society, language, and culture. We hold more legitimate claim to the Ducal Ring than any English or French King!"
 WMC_ideas:0 "Marches Ideas"
 WMC_ideas_start:0 "Marches Traditions"
 WMC_ideas_bonus:0 "Marches Ambition"
 WMC_idea_1:0 "Richard of York, Earl of March"
 WMC_idea_1_desc:0 "Richard of York is the wealthiest and most powerful noble in all of England, second only to the King himself.

 WMC_idea_2:0 "Shrewsbury Drapers Company"
 WMC_idea_2_desc:0 "The city of Shrewsbury is well positioned to become an epicenter of cloth production.

 WMC_idea_3:0 "Marchia Wallie"
 WMC_idea_3_desc:0 "The borderlands between England and Wales have always been contested. Because of this the border has always been fortified, going as far back as King Offa's Dyke.

 WMC_idea_4:0 "Settle the Frontier"
 WMC_idea_4_desc:0 "After the establishment of the Welsh Marches, several market towns began to spring up around the new castles. These mercantile cities include Chepstow, Monmouth, and Ludlow. All of them would become beacons of local wealth, and the beginning of large scale English settlement in Wales."
 WMC_idea_5:0 "Law of the March"
 WMC_idea_5_desc:0 "An interesting blend of Welsh Law and English Common Law, the Laws of the March can be difficult to follow. The specifics can vary from Lordship to Lordship, and the Law has never been properly codified. We must amend this if we seek to keep our autonomy from the King and to better rule over our subjects."
 WMC_idea_6:0 "Council of Wales and the Marches"
 WMC_idea_6_desc:0 "We should support the creation a regional administrative body, one that represents Wales, the Marcher Lords, and the border counties. This 'Council of Wales and the Marches' will act as a legislature and a court of law. This body of government shall be a tremendously useful boon to us."
 WMC_idea_7:0 "Laws in Wales Acts"
 WMC_idea_7_desc:0 "The reign of the Marcher Lords could not last forever. As times changed and England centralized, Parliament would seek to pass the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542. These laws would dissolve the Lordships, incorporate the Principality of Wales into England, and created many new shires out of the existing counties."
