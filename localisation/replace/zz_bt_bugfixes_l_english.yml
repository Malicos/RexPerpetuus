 desc_bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:1 "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula places it ideally to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly tranformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."
 desc_bt_amber_coast:1 "The Sambian Peninsula, occasionally called the 'Amber Coast', is the world's primary source of Amber. Mentioned specifically as early as the year 98 by the Roman historian Tacitus, 'Baltic Amber', as it is known, is so particularly abundant in the area that it washes up on the shoreline all on its own. The semi-precious stone is so abundant that despite being collected since distant antiquity, production continued to increase to the point that by the 18th century, it is believe that 95% of all finished amber produced worldwide originated from this region."

 #Fixing Draiocht's botching of my beer localisation.
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC2:1 "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top- and bottom-fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."

 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_desc:1 "Historically, women were able to inherit the duchy of Brittany, and our regnal histories proudly feature the names Jeanne, Alix, Berthe, and Havoise, but per the Treaty of Guérande, which ended the War of the Breton Succession, we observe primarily Salic inheritance laws, forbidding women to inherit unless there is no surviving male in the entire line. Unfortunately, François' infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pierre is also childless. The house of Montfort is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognise François' eldest daughter, Marguerite, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."
