 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME1:0 "Cession of the Kingdom of Italy"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC1:0 "Italy, long claimed by the emperor to be part of the Holy Roman Empire, has gradually slipped more and more from the Empire's control. Though occasionally emperors have been able to exercise some influence over the succession and laws in Northern Italy and there are many circles which pledge loyalty to the Empire, this politicking has become, more than anything else, a way to avoid the temporal power of the Pope, and a long string of coalitions and alliances designed to resist imperial influence have arisen, starting with the Lombard League in 1167.  Though the Empire's de-facto control over Italy was tenuous at points, it wasn't until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that imperial power was formally broken and all claims over Italy retracted by the emperor as a concession of the treaty to end the Thirty Years' War."
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA1:0 "Finally an end to the meddlesome emperor's control!"

 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME2:0 "Italian Loyalists"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC2:0 "Through the Peace of Westphalia, the Holy Roman Empire was force to release all claims over Italy, but it would appear that several imperial holdings on the peninsula don't wish to leave! We have received delagates from several Italian cities requesting our support to remain within the Empire and retain the full advantages that being a member of our noble Empire provides. We could easily accept these pledges of loyalty, but it might be seen as a violation of the treaty."
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA2:0 "We can't turn our backs to these imperial brothers."
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTB2:0 "We gave our word. Send the delegates away!"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME3:0 "Imperial Loyalists"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC3:0 "The emperor has accepted our pledge of loyalty and has allowed us to retain the status of full members within the Holy Roman Empire!

 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA3:0 "For the emperor!"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME4:0 "Removed from the Empire"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC4:0 "The emperor is either unwilling or unable to accept our pledge of loyalty, and has turned our delagates away. Italy is henceforth no longer an imperial holding and our nation losses all rights as an imperial fief, effective immediately."
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA4:0 "So it goes."
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME5:0 "The Kingdom of Italy and the Peace of Westphalia"
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC5:0 "Through the Peace of Westphalia, the Holy Roman Empire was force to renounce all claims over Italy, and many nearby countries have suddenly been removed from the Empire!"

 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC6:0 "Switzerland, long a central part of the Holy Roman Empire but in recent years increasing autonomous and discontented with imperial rule, was formally ceeded from the Empire as a concession of the Peace of Westphalia. All imperial claims have been withdrawn, and effective immediately Switzerland is to be considered a fully independent region."
 BtPLegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA6:0 "Interesting."

 mor_qasbah:0 "Qasbah"
 mor_qasbah_desc:0 "In order to show off their wealth, noblemen of Morocco would construct large citadels surrounded by great fortifications known as Qasbah. As a bonus, these fortifications also proved to be great defensive positions to wear out invaders. The fact that these fortifications received recognition in foreign languages is testimony enough of their greatness and shall inspire our citizens to contribute to our cause."
 mor_protect_transsaharan_trade:0 "Protect Trans-Saharan Trade"
 mor_protect_transsaharan_trade_desc:0 "The trans-Saharan trade routes, where merchants riding camels would transport salt from the Maghreb in exchange for slaves and gold, were a historically important part of Moroccan economy. The Portuguese however seem to think they can wrestle our control away from us using ships. This cannot do. As such, we need to move to secure the trade for ourselves!"
 mor_madrassa:0 "Madrasa"
 mor_madrassa_desc:0 "In Fez, there exists centers of learning known as Madrasas, the first of which is said to have been built in 859. Comparable to that of a university, these Madrasas are said to have been responsible for the city's reputation as that of an important intellectual centre, especially in the 14th century where several more Madrasae were built by the Marinids."
 mor_sharif_dynasties:0 "Sharif Dynasties"
 mor_sharif_dynasties_desc:0 "While the 15th century marked a long decline of the Moroccan state, the Arab Saadi dynasty would mark the beginning of a ruler period known as the Sharifian dynasties, with Sharif meaning noble-born.

 mor_legacy_of_ibn_battuta_desc:0 "Ibn-Battuta was a renowned Moroccan explorer who voyaged much of the known world in the 14th century, travelling to distant places such as Zanzibar, Constantinople, Timbuktu, Delhi and Beijing. If a single man such as this can explore the world, then there is little doubt that we can, as well."
 mor_jewel_of_the_maghreb:0 "Jewel of the Maghreb"
 mor_jewel_of_the_maghreb_desc:0 "Positioned in the fertile norwestern corner of Africa, our land is a lush oasis in an otherwise arid region and long the traditional center of Berber and Maghrebi Arab culture.

 mor_loyal_friends:0 "Strategic Alliances"
 mor_loyal_friends_desc:0 "On the 20th of December, 1777, Morocco became the first foreign nation to recognise the independence and sovereignty of the fledgling United States of America and offered protection from Barbary Pirates in the Atlantic, a gesture later formalised by an enduring friendship treaty. We shall follow this legacy and make it known that we make loyal friends, and terrifying enemies! In this manner we shall destabilize our rivals and strengthen our nation!"
 #mor_sale_corsairs:0 "Salé Corsairs"
 #mor_sale_corsairs_desc:0 "When King Philip III expulsed the Moriscos from Spain, they sought refuge in the town of Salé. Due to cultural difference however, these Moriscos settled on the other side of the Bou Regreg in Rabat. Using Rabat as a seat of operations they raided the shipping routes of the Atlantic, seizing ships for goods and captives. The corsairs become known as the Salé Rovers, with Rabat becoming known as \"New Salé\" by the English."
 #mor_restore_almohad_caliphate:0 "Restore the Almohad Caliphate"
 #mor_restore_almohad_caliphate_desc:0 "Once, the Almohads ruled a Berber caliphate that controlled much of al-Andalus. Then the Iberian Kingdoms began their Reconquista, reducing Muslim rule in al-Andalus to what came to be the Emirate of Granada. While many attempts at re-establishing rule over al-Andalus have been unsuccessful, we shall make sure to succeed where others have failed and let Islamic rule return to Iberia and beyond!"
