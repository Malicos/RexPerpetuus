 BtPLegacyIberianFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The Kingdom of Sicily had after the defeat of René of Anjou in 1443 been unified into a single entity under the Crown of Aragon. However, Alfonso V of Aragon had fathered an illegitimate son, and so during his reign decided to once again split up the Two Sicilies into two constituent kingdoms: One controlling the islands of Sicily & Malta, while the other controlled the parts on the Italian Peninsula. Upon his death, the rule of Naples was ceded to this illegitimate son, Ferdinand, while his brother John II of Aragon incorporated Sicily into the Crown of Aragon. This sparked a series of events such as Pope Calixtus III laying claims over all of Naples as a papal fief (Though he died before he could push these claims), as well as causing great unrest among the Neapolitan nobility. Eventually, when the Italian Wars erupted some decades down the line, the French kings claimed rightful succession to Naples itself and attempted its conquest. This ultimately failed, and Naples reunited under the Crown of Aragon 10 years later. And so, the Two Sicilies would remain ruled by Aragonese, and later Spanish, kings for centuries."

They were taxed by whatever nation that currently claimed ownership of their lands, but were otherwise left alone. In Sweden, a particular organisation known as the Birkarls arose and was responsible for the taxation of the Sami people, to the point of complete monopoly. It is notable that this was not a de jure position that they held, but rather a de facto one, signifying the autonomous rule of the monarch at the time, who in fact resided in Denmark. Nevertheless, they provided the monarch with valuable Sami furs that benefitted the nation. The status quo was kept until the Centralization reforms of Gustav Vasa, who figured that removing the middle hand that were the Birkarls would greatly increase the size of the Swedish treasury."

Their international influence and success were due to their geographical location, situated at the hearth of the trade roads and waterways coming from Italy, Flanders, Paris and Germany, but also by the enlightened management of the counts of Champagne. They were mainly held in the cities of Lagny, Troyes, Provins and Bar-sur-Aube and the counts also protected the Jewish community, which actively participated in business development of these towns. The fairs foreshadow by their economic and influence throughout Europe, the first international financial centres.

 chp_rose_of_provins:0 "Rose of Provins"
 chp_rose_of_provins_desc:0 "The legend wants that around 1240 Thibault IV of Champagne and Navarre had brought from the Holy Land a rose of excellent quality in the region and which he made important plantations in the lands of the city of Provins. The rose gardens of Provins soon became famous, and the use of the rose was extremely common in medicine and religious ceremonies. Thus, the flower became the symbol of the refinement of Champenoise court and the rose emblem of Lancaster probably represents the rose of Provins, as well."

The abbey illustrated a monastic model based on the erudition and represented an attempt to recognize women's intellectual equality."
 chp_wine:0 "Wine of Champagne"
 chp_wine_desc:0 "Produced since the 7th century in the region, wines of Champagne really started to receive recognition during the 17th century under the impulse of local Parisian families. Aging very badly in barrels, the wine is then conserved in glass bottles with corks, a new way of conserving wine developed by the English, but it becomes, in return, naturally sparkling. This sparkling character causes many worries to winemakers, so much that it was nicknamed 'wine of the devil' because of bottles that exploded under pressure. However, the wine became popular in England which allows its continued production. We should exploit the wine of Champagne to establish amical relations with foreign powers."

The construction of these towers began in the 16th century, and in 1730 Corsica was the home of 120 towers of this type scattered all over the coast.

 cor_pieves_desc:0 "The oldest known administrative division of Corsica is the pieve, a word coming from the Latin plebs (people) which already designated, a century before our era, an administrative district established by Rome. Though, the medieval pieve corresponds to a geographical and political organization quite different from the ones of the Roman constituencies. Indeed, depending of the era, the pieves were either a religious, civil, military or even political division, making them very versatile."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC5:0 "As the Enlightenment spread across Europe, several important advancements in science were made by natural philosophers. One of these advancements concerned the complex science of bees and their biology, a topic that had not previously been researched. Some notable pioneers were Jan Swammerdam & René Ferchault de Réamur, who used microscopes to dissect bees to understand internal bee biology. They observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but it was not until François Huber had his advisor conduct careful experiments that they understood the mating process of bees. They found that queens were inseminated through a number of successive matings with male drones, which occurred high in the air, distant from their hive. They were also the first to describe bees' reproductive organs. Huber is today regarded as the father of modern bee-science for his discoveries and research while simultaneously breaking new ground in the formative years of modern biology."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC6:0 "Beekeeping in Medieval and Renaissance Europe was a complex science that no regular peasant really understood. Beekeeping was therefore mostly left to the monks in abbeys, where the precious honey and beeswax was produced. This was not the only reason for its generally limited production, but in order to obtain said produce, beehives had to be destroyed, thus ruining any potential reuse of the bee colony. It also disallowed any potential selective breeding. This gradually changed during the 18th and 19th centuries, where successive inventions revolutionized beekeeping. Among these were Thomas Wildman's adjustments to beehive assembly. He fixed parallel arrays of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive. The bees would fix their combs onto these, which allowed for easy removal of beecombs without destroying the hive itself. These movable comb hives were later perfected by Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth, who made use of the fact that there was a specific clearance between the wax combs which bees left unblocked by wax, something Huber had previously discovered. Langstroth carefully designed a series of woooden frames in a rectangular hive box which were easily removed by beekeepers for emptying or inspection. Langstroth's invention ultimately lead to the commercial mass production of honey in the western world."
